## CORE API

The CORE API has a specific query language that allows you to explore a vast papers collection 
and perform complex queries.

Available operators:
| Operator       | Accepted symbols         | Meaning                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| And           | AND, +, space          | Logical binary and.                            |
| Or            | OR                     | Logical binary or.                             |
| Grouping      | (...)                  | Used to group elements of the query.           |
| Field lookup  | field_name:value       | Used to support lookup of specific fields.     |
| Range queries | fieldName(>, <,>=, <=) | For numeric and date fields range queries.     |
| Exists        | _exists_:fieldName     | Returns items where fieldName is not empty.    |

Available paper fields for filtering:
{
  "authors": [{"name": "Last Name, First Name"}],
  "documentType": "presentation" or "research" or "thesis",
  "publishedDate": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "title": "Title of the paper",
  "yearPublished": "2019"
}

Example queries:
- "machine learning AND yearPublished:2023"
- "maritime biology AND yearPublished>=2023 AND yearPublished<=2024"
- "cancer research AND authors:Vaswani, Ashish"
- "title:Attention is all you need"
- "mathematics AND _exists_:abstract"
"""

judge_prompt = """
You are an expert scientific researcher.
Your goal is to review the final answer you provided for a specific user query.

Look at the conversation history between you and the user. Based on it, you need to decide if 
the final answer is satisfactory or not.

A good final answer should:
- Directly answer the user query
- Answer extensively the request from the user
- Take into account any feedback given through the conversation
- Provide inline sources to support any claim made in the answer

In case the answer is not good enough, provide clear and concise feedback on what needs to be 
improved to pass the evaluation.
