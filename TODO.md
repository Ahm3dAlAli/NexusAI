# TODO

- use custom instructions in researches
- Update readme:
    - describe what each env variable is for. For example, not having Azure AD will disable the sign in with Microsoft button.
    - using openai instead of azure will likely degrade the performance of the agent. it's using 4o mini instead of gpt-4o because openai quotas are restrictive for low-tier users.
    - update description of features and architecture


## Github Copilot Hackathon
- text description of the project
