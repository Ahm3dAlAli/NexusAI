## Key Features

NexusAI offers the following key capabilities:

- **State-Driven Analysis**: Five-node system for orchestrated research with validation gates
- **Comprehensive Processing**: Automated paper retrieval, content extraction, and structure analysis
- **Quality Focused**: Multi-step validation and improvement cycles
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Flexible validation options for critical research tasks
- **Academic Integration**: Direct access to 136M+ papers through CORE API

## Architecture

NexusAI is built upon a layered architecture with three main components:

### 1. Workflow Engine
- StateGraph Architecture for orchestrated research
- Decision Making Node for query intent analysis
- Planning Node for research strategy formulation
- Tool Execution Node for paper processing
- Judge Node for quality validation

### 2. Paper Processing
- CORE API integration
- PDF content extraction
- Text structure preservation
- Metadata validation

### 3. Analysis Pipeline
- State-aware processing
- Multi-step validation
- Quality improvement cycles
- Human validation options

## Quickstart

First install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

Set up your environment variables:

```python

```

Basic usage example:

```python
from nexusai import ResearchAssistant

# Initialize the research assistant
assistant = ResearchAssistant()

# Analyze a research paper
results = assistant.analyze_paper("paper_url_or_query")

# Run a literature review
review = assistant.literature_review("quantum computing", year_range=(2023, 2024))
```

Evaluation using MacOS zsh

```python
python path/run_evaluation.py --services our_agent perplexity --interactive
```

## Use Cases
