Keeping up with the flood of academic papers is harder than ever for researchers. Manually reviewing this overwhelming volume of studies takes too much time, leading to missed insights or duplicated efforts. Modern research is also more complex, with key information spread across text, figures, tables, and equations, making it difficult to fully understand. Current tools for searching and analyzing papers aren’t smart enough — they struggle to understand deeper connections between studies, extract insights from complex formats, or summarize information effectively.

NexusAI transforms how researchers interact with scientific literature. It streamlines research by delegating the heavy lifting to an AI agent able to plan its own execution strategy, self-assess the quality of its work, and let the user ask further questions to dive deeper into the results. All with access to the most comprehensive academic search engines (arXiv, Bing, CORE, and Google).

# Features

NexusAI combines advanced AI research capabilities with enterprise-ready platform features to deliver a comprehensive research automation solution. The system is built on two main pillars: a sophisticated AI agent for intelligent research automation and a robust platform infrastructure for enterprise deployment.

### Core Agent Capabilities

The AI agent is designed to handle complex research tasks through a combination of advanced language models, specialized tools, and intelligent workflow management. These capabilities enable the agent to understand, plan, and execute research tasks with human-like comprehension while maintaining machine-like efficiency.

- 🧠 **Dual Processing Modes** - Intelligently routes queries through either a research workflow for complex questions or direct paper processing for document analysis, optimizing response strategies.
- 📋 **Dynamic Research Planning** - Creates adaptive research strategies using a multi-LLM approach (gpt-4o-mini for simple tasks, gpt-4o for complex ones) to optimize cost and performance.
- 🔄 **Multi-Provider Search** - Unified search interface across arXiv, Bing, CORE, and Serp APIs with provider fallback, ensuring comprehensive coverage and resilience.
- 📑 **Smart Document Processing** - RAG-powered content filtering with configurable dimension embeddings, automatically limiting processing to the most relevant sections of papers.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous Tool Execution** - Parallel processing of tool calls through async/await patterns, significantly reducing latency in multi-step research tasks.
- 🔍 **Iterative Quality Control** - Self-assessment system with configurable feedback loops (`MAX_FEEDBACK_REQUESTS`) for continuous refinement of responses.
- 💬 **Stateful Conversations** - Maintains conversation context through `AgentState` management, enabling coherent multi-turn interactions.

### Platform Features

The platform layer provides the infrastructure and interfaces necessary for deploying NexusAI in production environments. These features ensure security, scalability, and a seamless user experience while maintaining enterprise-grade standards.

- 🎨 **Intuitive Research Interface** - Minimalist chat-like interface with curated example research questions to help researchers quickly understand and leverage the platform's capabilities.
- 📚 **Research Management** - PostgreSQL-powered system for storing research history and paper collections, enabling users to access and continue previous research sessions while building their knowledge base.
- 💾 **Caching Layer** - Redis-based caching system for API responses and PDF content with provider-specific cache management, optimizing response times and reducing API costs.
- 🌐 **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket-based streaming of intermediate results with structured message types, providing researchers with live insights into the research process.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Experience** - System-level custom instructions feature allowing researchers to guide the agent's behavior and tailor its research approach to their specific needs.
- 🔐 **Enterprise-grade Security** - Comprehensive authentication system through NextAuth supporting email-password and Microsoft Azure AD, with JWT-secured API endpoints and WebSocket connections.

# Architecture

The backend implements two primary functionalities: Research Workflow and Paper Processing.

### Research Workflow

Orchestrated through a directed graph structure with the following nodes:

1. **Decision Making Node** - The entry point of the workflow that evaluates query complexity using gpt-4o-mini. It analyzes the user's request and produces a `DecisionMakingOutput` to determine whether research is required or if the query can be answered directly. The node supports custom instructions through markdown-formatted directives that influence the decision-making process.

2. **Planning Node** - A strategic component that creates detailed research plans based on the query complexity. It utilizes gpt-4o for complex planning tasks while falling back to gpt-4o-mini for simpler ones to optimize costs. The node creates structured research plans with explicit tool mappings and incorporates previous conversation context to avoid redundant searches.

3. **Tools Node** - The execution engine that handles all external interactions through asynchronous processing. It implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for reliability and manages two primary tools: a unified paper search interface across multiple providers and a PDF processing system for content extraction with RAG-based filtering.

4. **Agent Node** - The orchestrator that coordinates tool execution based on the planning output. It maintains the conversation state through `AgentState` and manages the streaming of intermediate results to clients through WebSocket connections, ensuring real-time visibility into the research process.

5. **Judge Node** - The quality control component that evaluates response quality through structured `JudgeOutput`. It implements configurable feedback loops with a default of 2 attempts and provides specific improvement directives when refinement is needed, ensuring high-quality research outputs.

### Paper Processing

This workflow transforms academic papers into structured summaries by accepting a paper URL, retrieving the document with the `PDFDownloader` tool, and using RAG-based filtering with Azure/OpenAI embeddings to process only the most relevant sections, generating a concise summary.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To immediately start using NexusAI, you can use our online demo [here](https://nexusai-platform.redisland-af07373c.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io). Alternatively, you can run the application locally by following the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vincenzofanizza/NexusAI.git
   cd NexusAI
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file by copying the provided template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   Configure your environment variables:

   #### Required Variables:
   ```env
   # Option 1: Azure OpenAI (Recommended for optimal performance)
   # Requires Azure OpenAI instance with these deployments:
   # - gpt-4o
   # - gpt-4o-mini
   # - text-embedding-3-small
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
   OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_openai_api_version

   # Option 2: OpenAI (Note: May have reduced performance due to quota limitations)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Database URL (default for Docker setup)
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres?schema=public"

   # Redis cache URL (default for Docker setup)
   REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379"

   # Authentication
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_string

   # Application URLs (default for Docker setup)
   FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL="ws://localhost:8000"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://backend:8000"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

   #### Optional Variables:
   ```env
   # Scientific papers databases (enhances search capabilities)
   CORE_API_KEY=your_core_api_key
   SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key
   BING_API_KEY=your_bing_api_key

   # Agent tracing and monitoring through Langsmith

   # Microsoft Authentication
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your_azure_ad_client_id
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_azure_ad_client_secret
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > - Using OpenAI instead of Azure OpenAI will result in reduced performance as the system will use more restrictive models due to OpenAI's quota limitations for low-tier users.
   > - While arXiv search is always available, it is recommended to provide API keys for additional paper databases (Bing, CORE, Serp) for enhanced search capabilities.
   > - Microsoft login will not work if Azure AD credentials are not provided, but email-password authentication will still work.

### Running with Docker

Start the application by running:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If that doesn't work, try running it without the dash:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command starts four services:
